# CSE3341-PROJECT   
Project created for CSE3341: Principles of Programming Languages. Course taken in Spring 2023.   

There are three projects in this repository.

The first project is a tokenizer for a toy language called core. 

It works in conjuction with the second project: an interpreter built for core
that handles parsing, printing, and executing procedures. There are a few sample programs, 
and new programs can be written for the language. A data file must also be provided, even
if it is empty and you are not reading any data.   

The third project is entirely disconnected from the first two, and is a program written in scheme48. There
is an expression I created called "eliminateNsort" that accepts two lists. It eliminates all elements in L1
that are also in L2, and then sorts the result. There are a number of simple, helper methods that accomplish this
to conform to the functional programming paradigm.
