Special Considerations:
 - Last project, Tyler had issues running my code and got an "IllegalAccessError".
   He was able to fix this by removing the ".java" in the command he ran. If this occurs again, give this a try.
 - I chose to do the object oriented approach, so you should be running my Main file.
 - I built this project with IntelliJ, so if you absolutely cannot get it to run, perhaps try opening it with
   IntelliJ (free for OSU students).

Files I am submitting:
 - My (slightly modified) tokenizer files Token.java, Tokenizer.java, and TokenUtil.java
 - My Main.java file that creates the tokenizer and runs it, then creates a Program and begins the parsing,
   printing, and executing procedures
 - Many Node files: Assignment.java, ComparativeOperation.java, Comparison.java, Condition.java, Declaration.java,
   DeclarationSequence.java, Expression.java, Factor.java, Id.java, IdList.java, If.java, In.java, INode.java,
   Loop.java, Operation.java, Out.java, Program.java, Statement.java, StatementSequence.java
 - My pretty printer helper class PrettyPrinter.java
 - My reader helper class Reader.java
